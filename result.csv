"""CCST9081 – All You’ve Ever Wanted to Know About Humans""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Humans, people, Homo sapiens… who, or what, are we? Although we can marvel at the amazing accomplishments of our species (technology, art, biological adaptations), how much is actually known about our own evolution and development that has enabled us to get to this point?This course will take you on a six-million-year-long journey and challenge you to rethink what makes us human. How is it that we diverged from our ape and monkey cousins and went down an evolutionary pathway distinctly our own, yet still connected to other species? How did we go from living as hunter-gatherers to now being members of a globally interlinked population of over 7 billion? Why is it that we still have so much conflict, injustice, and inequity? Does that define us, or does compassion, cooperation and community-building?Borrowing from history, linguistics, forensic science, cultural studies, genetics and the biological sciences to better understand the human condition, we will also come to better understand ourselves as contemporary historians, scientific thinkers and social groups. This journey from the distant past to the present, with a glance toward the future, requires no previous knowledge of the topics, but only the curiosity to look into a mirror and see what we can find out about what it means to be “human”.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr M.B.C.

"""CCCH9026 – Rule of Law and China’s Economic Miracle""","This course aims to explore an intriguing puzzle in the rise of contemporary China: How has the country achieved rapid economic growth in the past four decades in the absence of Western-style legal and democratic systems, both of which are conventionally viewed to be essential to economic development? Arising from this puzzle is heated debate worldwide over the relative efficacy of the so-called Beijing vs. Washington Consensuses. In order to unwind this puzzle, the course examines three key issues: (i) how China’s economic reform can be understood in the historical and comparative context, specifically the relevance of the East Asian developmental states model; (ii) what role China’s legal system as well as the relationship between law and politics has played in the country’s economic development; (iii) whether China’s experience can be called “growth without rule of law,” and whether it presents viable alternative that may inform other developing economies in their pursuit of prosperity. The course covers the following aspects of the Chinese legal and political systems in investigating their relationship to the country’s economic growth: legitimacy building, decentralization as a constitutional system, courts, governance of state-owned enterprises, formal and informal financing, property rights protection, environmental protection, labor regulation, China’s global economic engagements, and cyber governance.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr Z.

"""CCHU9012 – Body, Beauty and Fashion""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:This course takes students on an exploration of the links between body, beauty and fashion from a variety of perspectives ranging from sociology, social policy, economics, psychology and medicine. These various perspectives together offer students a way of seeing how individual level issues (like self-esteem, stigma and identity) shape and are shaped by community level issues (mass media), societal level issues (gender) and global level issues (globalization and westernization). The course examines these issues in a variety of formats using guest lectures, mass media analysis, video clips, problem solving activities and discussion. The course also focuses on cultural representations and understandings of the human body and ideals of beauty. Although the emphasis is primarily on contemporary Hong Kong society, lectures will also include in-depth analyses of how beauty is culturally constructed and historically situated around the world. To this end, the course is gender inclusive and presents both the female and male perspectives on beauty and body image. In this context, how human bodies and standards of beauty are increasingly influenced by a global media, which promotes a progressively narrow concept of beauty, will be critically discussed. Aside from the media influence on an increasingly globalized interpretation of beauty standards, the course also explores how diet and fashion industries are gaining momentum in shaping beauty ideals. Lectures address other globally and socially constructed aspects of beauty and identity, such as: race, class, culture, ethnicity, sexual identity, age, and ability/disability.",First semester (Wed),"- Professor K.A.

"""CCGL9032 – Rule of Law in a Globalizing World""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:The footprint of the Rule of Law can be found throughout the world in almost all domestic jurisdictions. However, the Rule of Law is implemented differently across jurisdictions depending on whether a “thin” or “thick” concept of the Rule of Law is applied as well as the goals in introducing the Rule of Law into a society. With these differences, the functions and role of the legal institutions which implement the Rule of Law are also different.Understanding the concept of the Rule of Law to be a continuum provides the context for studying the impact of globalization on the developmental pathway of the Rule of Law. On the one hand, the forces of globalization and the rise of global institutions and non-state actors contribute to the promotion of Rule of Law principles and establishment of rule-based systems at both international and national levels. On the other hand, new issues emerge posing challenges to the Rule of Law in different localities.Students from across all the faculties will work together to understand the developmental processes of the Rule of Law in different societies and the multi-faceted relationships between globalization and the Rule of Law.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr S.

"""CCCH9044 – Dunhuang and the Silk Road: Art, Culture and Trade""","The Silk Road has long linked the West with China and one of its principle sites is the Cave of Dunhuang. Both Dunhuang and the Silk Road have long been dynamic places for the creation and transmission of diverse cultural content that can be studied from the perspectives of travelers, art and architecture, languages, and many different religious traditions. The Cave’s long and cosmopolitan history has, in fact, become the subject of a distinct academic field known as “Dunhuangology.”How does the art and culture of Dunhuang reflect the cross-cultural features played out in the geographical and sociopolitical contexts of the Silk Road? And how can we understand the importance of preserving such a cultural heritage for future generations, even as the concept of the Silk Road is now being renewed and transformed? This course will adopt interactive teaching approaches to stimulate students’ knowledge of this rich heritage and will also enable students to gain a broader view of Chinese culture and civilization from the Cave of Dunhuang across the commercial and cultural exchanges passing along the Silk Road. Major analytic tools such as stylistic analysis, epigraphy and archeological evidences, etc., drawn from different academic disciplines, will be discussed in the course to illustrate how to find out the purposes of and the skills in creating those artifacts unearthed.The theme-based lectures, which will include reflection and interactive exercises, will be structured around three interrelated topics: 1) the role and influence of Dunhuang on the Silk Road and vice versa, 2) the material, artistic and intellectual cultures along the Silk Road, and 3) the value of cultural heritage and memory as we move into the future.

"""CCST9032 – “Intelligent” Architecture and Sustainability""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Emerging in our midst is intelligent architecture, which in this course refers to intelligent built environments: dynamic systems with the capacity to respond intelligently and immediately to various human and environmental stimuli for our benefit. What makes these built environments “intelligent” is their ability to react positively and spontaneously to forces of nature, to fluctuating climates, to human activity, to cultural nuances and to human expectations. Intelligent architecture harnesses not only evolving technology but also valuable insights and lessons from the forms and processes that occur in nature. This enables it to provide enhanced productivity, safety, comfort and quality living. The central aim of this course is to explore the world of intelligent built environments and the mutual impact, relationships and evolution they have in the culture and daily lives of people. First-hand exploration involving experiential learning and direct activation of the senses, will be a key component of the course. This complements discussions that would uncover and reveal, in broad and general terms, the underlying principles and technologies that allow buildings to perform smartly. Students will also be encouraged to unleash their imagination to construct future scenarios that the concept of intelligent architecture may lead to.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr B.S.

"""CCST9018 – Origin and Evolution of Life""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Among the most fundamental questions we can ask ourselves as humans are: Where do we come from – how did life begin and evolve? Are we alone – is the Earth unique in our universe in supporting life? Where are we going – what is the long-term future for humankind? These questions focus on the origin, evolution and future of life, a field of study termed “astrobiology”. Answers to these questions have been sought via scientific inquiry throughout human history and technological advances have now created paradigm shifts in the way that society reconciles new scientific findings with accepted norms and belief-systems. The course will examine: (i) how the conditions for life arose on early Earth and perhaps elsewhere and how advances in science and technology have changed our perception of the origins of life; (ii) the various scientific studies supporting the emergence of life, the evolution and diversification of life beginning with simple molecular systems, compartments (cells) to the evolution of intelligent self-conscious life; and (iii) the societal implications of discovering extraterrestrial life.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr K.H.

"""CCGL9067 – Companies and People: Friends or Foes?""","[This is a certified Communication-intensive (Ci) Course which meets all of the requirements endorsed by HKU’s Senate, including i) the teaching and assessment of visual and digital communication ‘literacies’; and ii) at least 40% of the course grade assigned to communication-rich assessment tasks.] Do you know the differences between “businesses,” “companies,” and “corporations”? This course will explore how individuals and groups of people came to transact business through companies, and what the increasing impacts have been of corporate growth on the world. The invention of the “company” as a way to do business has been pivotal to dramatically raising living standards around the world and spurring innovation in countless industries. Today, nearly every business larger than a street vendor is conducted through a corporate form, and most people living in industrialized nations are employed by companies. Yet as companies have grown ever richer, they have increased in power and political influence, and heightened social inequalities, leading much of the public to put the blame for societal problems like climate change, wealth gaps, and recurring financial crises on companies (especially large, multinational firms).This course will investigate the impact of the corporation on individuals and humanity, asking questions about how (or whether) societies should regulate corporations to enhance human welfare. Its assessments are designed to help students learn to respond logically and thoughtfully to these issues, as well as to form real-world, transferable skills like different means of persuasion, crafting effective writing for a public, and forming mock companies.",First semester (Wed),"- Mr B.L.

We will explore fundamental theories about religion and secularism in modernity and case studies of spirituality that reflect and confound these categories. Our exploration of ideas and practices that distinguish spirituality from organized religion will begin with early esoteric and “New Age” movements of the late 19th and early 20th Century such as Theosophy, Anthroposophy and the self-realization fellowship of Paramahansa Yogananda as a foundation for modern movements of spirituality in the era of the “disenchantment the world” and what Nietzsche called the “death of God.” The course will then pursue more recent forms of spiritualities in North America, Europe, and Asia. Students will learn to analyse the modern search for meanings and the desire for belonging and ecstatic experience amidst a complex landscape of pluralism, secularism and post-colonialism. In a moment where kindness performance indicators are in decline and where community has been displaced by isolation and even depression, an exploration of the human search for higher values is a critical tool for contemporary analysis.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr A.J.

We examine closely how empirical evidence is used to arrive at robust findings of falling inequality globally, but rising inequality within nations. Simple economic ideas on economic growth, international trade and investments are learned and used to explain why the spread of markets and economic globalization has fostered growth and reduced poverty in many poor nations. We also examine why some poor nations have failed to grow and remain mired in poverty. We also consider why poverty has not been eliminated in rich countries and why inequality has increased in recent decades. The role of human capital investments, technological advances, and political economy factors are introduced and used to investigate the experiences of the rich economies, including Hong Kong.The course helps students to:Students are introduced to examples of how political processes in one nation can impact development outcomes in another nation.

"""CCHU9018 – Art and Ideas: East and West""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:This course is about ideas that are related to art, art history and visual culture across cultural boundaries of “the East” and “the West”. It is designed to explore ideas about art, such as how art functions in various societies and its meanings. It will examine artistic traditions, the functions of art and its institutions such as patronage, art market, and roles of the artist across cultures, and will challenge assumptions about separation of cultural realms into eastern and western areas. The course will explore key monuments and concepts that shaped artistic traditions, techniques, and media and continue to define today’s international visual environment.Art as a concept belongs to all cultures, and deploys similar strategies to create meaning. Through the application of linguistic theories, the course will look at strategies of art production and consider the meanings of certain works of art within specific cultural and historical situations. It aims to develop the skills of asking questions of a work of art and using historical knowledge along with some careful looking to answer these questions. Students will encounter works of art, not necessarily in chronological order, but connected together by common themes.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr R.L.

"""CCHU9022 – Journey into Madness: Conceptions of Mental Health and Mental Illness""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of: Course DescriptionPortrayed by mass media, there is an exaggerated link between mental illness and violence. Mental illness is often considered as an adversary that should be dealt with by medical professionals. Challenging this monopolized medical discourse on mental illness, this course aims to expand the students’ view to appreciate how mental illness has been psychologically influenced, socially constructed and policed, as well as culturally shaped. Coupling biochemistry’s knowledge of mental illness with self-reflections, students are expected to develop a critical and comprehensive understanding of mental illness and mental health. With the use of experiential exercises, case studies, and film viewing, students will be further encouraged to scrutinize mental health issues in their daily lives. As there is a growing number of individuals challenged by mental illnesses both locally and internationally, students will have high chance of encountering an individual with mental illnesses in their social circles, workplaces or even family in the future. The development of a comprehensive and critical view towards mental illnesses will definitely prepare them to face this future challenge.[All students will be required to plan and organize a compulsory experiential learning activity for service users at a mental health agency/setting during Reading Week. The experiential activity is compulsory and if interested students foresee that they cannot commit to this, they should not be enrolling in this course. Depending on the pandemic the activity may be shifted online.]Course Learning OutcomesOn completing the course, students will be able to:Describe conceptions of mental health and mental illness.Critically appraise the contributions and limitations of the various conceptions of mental health and mental illness.Understand how certain mental health issues have been conceived and defined through a dynamic interplay of various biomedical, psychological, sociological and cultural perspectives.Develop cultural sensitivity towards intercultural differences in understanding and responding to issues in mental health and mental illness.Offer Semester and Day of TeachingFirst semester (Wed)Portrayed by mass media, there is an exaggerated link between mental illness and violence.

"""CCHU9056 – Virtual Worlds, Real Bodies""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:How have modern virtual reality technologies (VR) shaped and influenced the way we perceive reality, communicate and interact with each other, and with the world? In what ways do these cyber machines play a part in diminishing the physical barrier between the human body and the external world, and extending our living experiences across space and time, thereby transcending geographical, cultural and knowledge boundaries? And how do these experiences differ from the traditional communication mediums? By engaging students on an explorative journey of the emergence and development of VR in our modern societies, and giving them hands-on practice in creating their own virtual worlds, this course encourages students to reflect, evaluate and contemplate from multiple perspectives on how modern computer and digital technologies “inhabit” our bodies, and the world. Through realizing how our physical bodies have come to embody such technologies and making them an inseparable part of our everyday realities, we thereby expand the horizon of human experiences and meaning making. And ultimately, through grasping the notion of techno-embodiment, students are expected to raise and attempt to answer the philosophical and ethical questions of what technologies can and cannot do, and should and should not do in creating new human living experiences.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr Y.

The course will explore how this progression may be the result of genetic selection, but likely more the result of selection acting on ideas, or memes, rather than genes, but in an analogous manner.Through an understanding of human evolution, the origin of economic development will be explored. Combined with the psychological perspective of understanding the individual, we attempt to shed light on how complex civilization has come into existence. Lectures will ask one or two main scientific questions and then focus on answering them, showing the types of evidence that can be used to address the question and the logical progression of ideas.","Course will be offered twice:

Because some things created or modified by past humans have survived until today, they can open a window on these people, helping us explore how we became who we are and who we will become. The archaeologist’s goal is to excavate, examine, and analyze the stuff of the past to understand our own and others’ lived experiences. This class will work together to explore the past and its relationship to the present – while simultaneously considering the things in our own daily lives.

"""CCGL9021 – Globalization and Tourism""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:The issue of whether globalization is beneficial remains controversial, particularly since globalization policies are often examined without consideration of their interactions with key sectors of economy, notably tourism. Tourism is one of the world’s largest industries and is considered to be a promising means of fostering economic development by the governments of many developing countries. However, it is questionable whether income generated through tourism can deliver improved economic independence and higher quality of life to the developing world. This course aims to use tourism as a lens to explore key issues of globalization and economic development and critique how tourism, a global phenomenon, influences local people’s lives. Course objectives are to 1) introduce key concepts relevant to tourism and globalization; 2) apply theoretical frameworks to the analysis of contemporary issues of the globalization of tourism, and the complex relationships that link local, regional, national and international processes and patterns of tourism development; 3) explore the relationships between the forces of globalization, multinational tourism corporations, and the state and civil society; and 4) interrogate the economic, political and social ramifications of the systemic sources of power and inequality which are reflected in and sustained by international tourism. Finally, this course will also consider the future of tourism with regard to new sectors and trends such as ecotourism, adventure tourism, and the effects of social media and the Internet, along with what travel will look like in a post-COVID-19 world both in and beyond Hong Kong.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr Patrick J.

Do animals have emotion? Can robots have emotion? To what extent can we control our emotion? Or is emotion controlling us? It is important to explore the genesis of human emotion as it strongly affects human behavior, especially the extreme forms. To explore the questions above, we need to visit different fields of knowledge, including philosophy, psychology, and biology.

With the recent rapid developments in health technologies, many aspects of human health can now be addressed in ways that are simply unimaginable even in the recent past. In this course, we will examine how such “biomedical miracles” have offered us huge promises, but at the same time also have created new challenges that could be perhaps potentially perilous. We will see how humans are increasingly being involved or confronted with a problem of a startling scale whereby promises and perils arising from new biomedical discoveries are found to be fueling each other to grow, that can be likened to solving a very peculiar puzzle whereby finding the first piece of the puzzle immediately makes it more difficult to identify the next piece.Such an interesting phenomenon will be vividly illustrated by examples found in the application of knowledge of the human genome, organ transplantation, antibiotics, and cell communications. Learning in this course adopts an interactive, multi-activity, student-centered and inquiry-based approach with the close assistance and attendance of tutors. Experiential learning is a main feature of this course so as to stimulate and to expand those core intellectual skills on which learning depends. On the completion of this course, students are expected to acquire transdisciplinary vision on real-life problems/matters in which biomedical science is a major constituent.[Lectures and tutorials will be held in an integrated manner each week on Wednesday from 16:30 – 19:20.

"""CCHU9068 – Shaping our World: Liberalism, Socialism and Nationalism""","This course introduces students to liberalism, socialism and nationalism as a complex set of very powerful ideas that have influenced the political, economic and cultural development of Europe, and, subsequently, the world. We are now all living in a period where all of these systems are being questioned and reconfigured.Liberalism places the individual at the center of things and gave birth to the core concepts of liberty, equality, and individual rights. Socialism gave rise to other concepts like fraternity, a community of workers, and the redistribution of wealth. Nationalism focuses its identity on the nation-state, and, often, on particular groups within the nation as the source of political power. We will explore the intellectual mainsprings of these movements through excerpts from their writings of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Smith, Montesquieu, Kant, Herder, Hegel, Mill, Marx, Lenin, Schmitt, Arendt, Freud, Nietzsche, de Beauvoir, Foucault, Keynes, Hayek, Rawls, Nozick and Friedman. Students will be asked to engage in debates and to articulate how these global movements shape their own lives today in very tangible ways.All three philosophies have given birth to social movements—sometimes violent and sometimes peaceful—across the world. Together, they have shaped the modern world of nation-states and market economies, emigration and immigration, human rights and terrorism, economic crises and world wars. The apparent triumph of liberalism in the late 20th century is now being challenged and reassessed, but its revolutionary vision remains a vital body of ideas.Each ideology has reacted and responded to an increasingly integrated economic world and to each other over the course of their histories. Their enduring influence and continued relevance make them worthy subjects of study for comprehending the world in which we all live.",First semester (Sat),"- Professor R.Y.C.

"""CCHU9002 – Battles for Bodies: The Birth of Surveillance Society""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:What is the state’s final frontier? How and why have governments around the world been vested with the authority to manage the most intimate aspects of our existence: from the food we eat to our sexual behaviour? What has the impact of this encroachment been on our sense of self? Engaging with these questions from an historical perspective provides a critical lens for re-evaluating our own relationship to society and the state, as well as furnishing a context for considering the extent to which we are ever fundamentally “free” to possess our own bodies. Exploring the birth of “surveillance society” enables us to reflect upon – and challenge – the inherited assumptions which underpin our reliance on government and our aspirations for personal autonomy. This course ranges from the formation of the modern state in Europe and the techonologies it developed for managing populations, to global health surveillance and recent biomedical advances which have resulted in progressively interventionist governmental measures, with profound social, political and ethical implications. Topics include: surveillance; “medical police” and state-sponsored interventions in eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europe; the invention of the “population” as a collective body; colonialism and the global exportation of ideas about what is “normal”; “healthy citizens”: the coercive state and the democratization of society; and, finally, the limits of public health in the twenty-first century.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr A.Y.W.

Besides examining the various forces that prompted the modernization process in East Asia, students will scrutinize the various factors and processes involved. For example: How did interaction with people and things from other regions of the world affect political and cultural identities in China and other East Asian societies, and how did East Asia countries like China transform from being predominantly agricultural civilizations to having the diverse and dynamic economies we witness today? This course also questions whether modernization is mainly about economic development and the construction of a sustainable state structure or should it encompass broader advances in ideology and the adoption of values and norms like the protection of particular rights for individuals and groups. Students will also consider big challenges connecting the past, present, and future such as what are the positive and negative consequences of modernization that affect the natural environment and human relations. These issues will be examined thematically and comparatively by scrutinizing political and social institutions such as the family, marriage, education and social mobility, and other topics.

"""CCHU9065 – A Life Worth Living""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:What does it mean to live a worthy life? This is one of the most fundamental questions of human existence and this course addresses the relevant issues through an engagement with various philosophical and religious traditions, such as Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Christianity and Secular Humanism. We shall discuss how the teachings of important historical figures from these traditions have influenced the choices of people over the centuries, and how they have been contextualized and adopted in contemporary society. We shall examine how these figures regard the place of bodily pleasures, intellectual pursuits, power, status, possessions, accomplishments, virtues, relationship with other human beings and the relationship (or not) with the transcendent in their vision of a good life. We will explore the resources they offer for dealing with stress, temptations, disappointments and failures, social oppression, the loss of possessions and of loved ones, and with one’s own death. The course will help students connect across different disciplines and cultures, and develop the ability to examine controversial issues from multiple perspectives. Students will achieve these aims through interactive learning and high impact practices such as group debates and interviewing contemporary advocates of different worldviews concerning the question of “what makes a worthy life?”",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr C.

"""CCCH9037 – Chinese Mythology""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:The purpose of this course is to examine China’s rich repository of myths from a socio-historical perspective and to consider their cultural significance in both an ancient and contemporary context. By introducing students to a select list of Chinese myths, both well-known and lesser-known ones, and inviting them to compare China’s mythological tradition to that of other ancient civilizations such as Greece, Scandinavia and Native America, a macroscopic examination of the relation between myths and qualities that are conceived of as traditionally Chinese will be conducted. Along the way, students will be encouraged to examine various Chinese myths from different perspectives (i.e. cultural, anthropological and psychological), and contemplate on their roles within the development of Chinese cultural identity.In the end, this course hopes to encourage students to consider the role of myths in both ancient times and today’s modernizing society and the way the changing interpretation of specific mythological motifs can be analyzed as reflective of changes in cultural values.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr I.M.C.

"""CCST9036 – Frontiers in Materials: Civilisation, Industry, and Well-Being""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:“Materials Frontiers” underpin the survival and success of many sectors, from cosmetics and the creative industries, sports and well-being, energy and environment, mobility and transport, to quantum and metaverse technologies. Materials are ubiquitous, yet unique in their properties. Though the fundamental building blocks of materials were created soon after the Big Bang, their individual and collective behaviours continue to elude our mastery even with Big Data! They have emerged as a bedrock of human civilisation, underpining the ancient Three Ages (Stone, Bronze and Iron) to the modern Four Industrial Revolutions (1.0 to 4.0),  and shall become a beacon of societal advancement, “shining” into the quantum, the metaverse and the great unknown.On the other hand,  each of us has already been equipped with materials covering more than half of the Periodic Table of the Elements – over 40 are in a smart phone. The rapid advancement in any modern technology is a consequence of the development of many new types of materials and our ability to make them sustainably and cost-effectively. For example, the discovery of silicon in the 19th century and the invention of the transistor in the 20th century paved the road for the “Information Age”. The development of graphene and related low-dimensional materials are poised to take us to a new “Age of Experience”.The course is designed to introduce materials frontiers by a “top-down” approach in the context of current challenges and/or future applications. The purposes are to: 1) offer students a heuristic perspective of materials discovery for societal advancement; 2) equip students with a holistic understanding of materials types and technologies for key industrial sectors; and 3) inspire students with grand challenges and potential materials innovations for smart and sustainable development. The underlining principles in the design, processing, and functionalization of different types of materials will be naturally integrated into the application-oriented thematic topics.",Second semester (Wed),"- Professor Z.X.

"""CCST9075 – Be Fit! Be Active!""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:What’s stopping you from being fit and physically active?Humankind has evolved rapidly, having set physical activity as a primary pillar for our survival and health. However, we are currently living in an era where we become less physically active and more sedentary. What is it that makes us choose to adopt a physically inactive and sedentary lifestyle, when we know the negative health impacts of it? This course will help you solve this intertwined mystery, which will help you sustain a healthier and happier life.To unfold the box of this enigma, we first need to understand the inter-disciplinary nature of exercise, and physical activity determinants. Through a series of themed lectures we will explore together how individuals’ participation in exercise and physical activity is determined not only by personal factors, but also by contextual, cultural, and environmental factors.“Be Fit! Be Active!” is a course that aims to radically change your understanding of the essence of bodily movement. You will not only acquire a strong theoretical background, but also engage in hands-on tasks and experience. Having completed practically useful projects, you will have the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of real-world interventions and learn in-depth about the fundamental techniques needed to design programmes and policies aimed at increasing physical activity and well-being.[A field trip will be held in Reading Week.]",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr Y.

We are now increasingly in charge of our health, assuming new roles in seeking information, understanding rights and responsibilities, and making health decisions. Underlying these demands, however, are the needs for the knowledge and skills to navigate the sea of information (and misinformation) to make smart decisions about health. Health literacy goes beyond having the basic ability of understanding and applying language, literacy and numeracy skills to process health information. It is also about having the knowledge, confidence and skills to interpret information. Raising the importance of health literacy among young adults is an important step for creating a healthy campus and urban environment. This course will equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to understand health information to their fullest, empower them to make informed decisions, encourage students to question the reliability of information, and to think critically about scientific evidence. A skills-based and analytic approach will be taken, where attention will be given to the transferability of reading, numeracy and communication skills.

"""CCHU9053 – Contested Words, Disputed Symbols""","This course is under the thematic cluster of:Words and symbols, as two indispensable kinds of signs created and maintained for human communication, are often the subject of profound controversy. To explore how contestable these signs are, we can delve into several essential questions: What is the nature of words/symbols/signs? How do we identify them and prolong their identity (enough for us to recount and argue about the ‘same word’/‘same symbol’)? How do they mean – with reference to an ontological reality, or not at all? Based on the answers to the above, how do we strike a balance between the determinacy of words and symbols needed for stabilization, equality and fairness, correctness, etc., and the indeterminacy of these signs for creativity and the freedom to express oneself?These are questions we will address and rethink over and over again as we dive into the multitude of discourses in which we find something about words or symbols disputable – discourses such as law, science, gender, race, linguistics, digital communication, etc. By analyzing such disputes, we will realize that they are merely manifestations of an essential nature of language and communication, and come to reflect on people’s communicative strategies and reflexivity, the sources of authority to which they appeal and the types of identity/power positions they take. At stake in such disputes include but are not limited to people’s freedom of expression, their own voice in society, the control and censorship of the public sphere, the boundary between lay and non-lay discourse, the ownership of symbols and words, and the right to control their origin, use and/or interpretation.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr S.M.K.

In ten years, it dismantled the state, party, and economy with widespread social upheaval and violence, followed by unrelenting oppressive campaigns. It dramatically exploded the inherent contradictions of the Communist State. It has exerted a major impact on the direction of Chinese politics, economic reforms, and public protests. This course explores the causes, processes, and impact of the Cultural Revolution (CR), asking why millions of people participated in the CR, who were the agents responsible for the CR, what determined the CR’s multifaceted courses, and what legacy the CR left for the following reform era and the coming future. It introduces students to key intellectual ideas and methodologies from multi-disciplines – history, political and social science, literature, and film. Students will learn to critically assess sources and statements, through which to discover how history is continuously constructed and contested.","Courses will be offered four times

"""CCST9063 – The Unseen: Invaders, Healers, and the Microbial World""","Microorganisms are very small organisms that often can only be seen under microscope, but that form communities in many parts of our body and play important roles in maintenance of our health. While some microorganisms are capable of causing diseases, the vast majority of them can co-exist with us in harmony and some even have positive effects on our bodies. Most interestingly, the microorganism composition within each person is unique, similar to a fingerprint. In this interdisciplinary course, we will cover: 1) the types of microorganisms that can be normally found within our body; 2) the importance in the maintenance of a balanced microbial community within our body for a healthy life; 3) how modern medicine and lifestyles can affect our microbial community and hence our health; 4) current opinions in using microorganisms and microorganism-derived compounds as therapeutic agents from both Western and traditional Chinese medicine point of views; 5) introduce some basic tools to study and identify disease-causing microorganisms; and 6) explore some controversial issues in the prevention and management of infectious diseases. Throughout the course, we will move back and forth between areas of scientific knowledge and the student’s own experience of an intimate “community” beyond “normal” perception.[There will be a 3-hour field trip and a 1-hour lap tour (tentatively) scheduled for Saturday afternoon during Reading Week which are compulsory.]",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr M.L.

"""CCST9020 – Sustainable Development of the Built Environment""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:“First we shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.” (Winston Churchill)An ever-growing awareness of the adverse impacts that humans are having upon the natural environment is prompting a greater public awareness of the need to live in a sustainable manner. An opportunity to enact such a manner of living is no greater than the very place we spend a significant portion of our lives: the built environment. The sustainable functioning of large cities, such as Hong Kong, offers an ideal opportunity to positively influence the present and future impact of human activities on our planet.Students of this course should gain an informed understanding of the central issues associated with sustainable development of the built environment and the ways in which these issues have been responded to throughout history and the present day. The central question is about continued quality development of the built environment into the future. Students will develop their ability to critically reflect on the different strategies, best practices and technologies to tackle issues of the built environment in a systematic manner.Topics specific to this course include (i) global issues related to the natural and built environment, (ii) the sustainable development framework applied to the built environment and associated technologies, (iii) relevant ethical, socio-economic, philosophical and political issues and the role of different stakeholders, (iv) energy and carbon, and (v) case studies locally and abroad. Students will be expected to attend lectures and tutorials, participate in tutorial discussions, search literature and read widely, and also undertake a field trip (within Hong Kong) and report on their learning experience.[A half-day field trip will be held off-campus in Hong Kong during Reading Week. Three options of time will normally be provided for the field trip, and students will be required to choose one for participation.]",First semester (Wed),"- Professor K.

Such trends raise a host of social and economic questions for our society. This course examines whether government policies and individual behavior respond appropriately and adequately to these population changes, to sustain economic development and maintain the well-being of all citizens.This course has three components. First, it briefly reviews the history of global demographic changes, and their socio-economic effects. Second, it uses cross-country comparisons to illustrate how some current problems in various countries may be related to behavioral and policy issues which originated from an earlier era. Lastly, we will examine appropriate individual behavior and government policies in the coming decades when societies such as Hong Kong, China, and others around the world are aging rapidly.Students taking this course are expected to understand the current socio-economic effects of previous demographic changes. Moreover, the course enables them to have self-reflection on whether, and in what sense, their current behavior and future plans related to work, saving decisions, health-related activities, and retirement decisions are appropriate in light of the emerging demographic landscape. They are also given the opportunities to start thinking about appropriate policies for our society, both locally and globally, to face these new challenges.",First semester (Sat),"- Professor S.H.

"""CCGL5048 – Global Crime and Injustice (Online)""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:[Lectures and tutorials of this course will be delivered online.]This course aims to introduce students to the varied ways of thinking about the crime problem and the consequences of the globalization of economic, political and cultural activities across the world. It introduces a number of key concepts in sociology, criminology and human rights that will help students develop a more inclusive and imaginative picture of how their lives are shaped by events and social institutions far removed from their local contexts and the range of harms that individuals and communities may be subjected to across the global North and South divide. Just as ‘global’ issues such as warfare, human trafficking, and environmental problems must be understood in an international context, so too must traditionally ‘local’ arenas of criminological interest be located within a comparative perspective, and understood as being shot-through with transnational and global dimensions. Overall, the course will examine whether and how globalization may bring various risks and new harms which challenge our conventional understanding of the problem of crime and justice. In this context, there is growing recognition of the importance of new geographical sites of knowledge production, in particular those beyond traditional Anglo-American bases of power. This course will therefore equip students with the theoretical and methodological tools to ‘reach for the global’ in their criminological imagination by drawing on a range of case-studies framed from the global and comparative perspective. ",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr P.

"""CCHU9013 – Cultural Heritage in the Contemporary World""","Welcome to the world of cultural heritage! This course examines the background, debates, policies, and politics of cultural heritage from interdisciplinary perspectives, particularly through the sociological and anthropological lens. UNESCO includes a wide range of definitions of cultural heritage, such as ‘tangible’ and ‘intangible’ heritage. All categories of cultural heritage are now regarded as essential to community building, proper governance, and economic development. The preservation, conservation, destruction, demolition, listing and delisting of heritage sites and historic documents have regularly attracted media and public attention, commercial interest, and contention among different communities. By introducing thematic issues through case examples from Hong Kong and other places around the world, students will be introduced to basic readings on cultural heritage, conservation policies, heritagization, tourism industries and the latest trends of heritage preservation.There are four key themes in our course. First, we will explore the meaning of cultural heritage, and highlight some general issues and approaches to the study of heritage. Second, we will critically examine the socio-cultural significance of cultural heritage with different case examples. Third, we will consider the management of cultural heritage, including different preservation and conservation methods, as well as the politics behind the making and protection of heritage. Finally, we will look at the uses of cultural heritage in urban development and tourism. Together, we will explore our cultural stories, rituals, architectures, and ways of living. Come learn with us the cultural richness of Hong Kong and beyond.[An optional field trip will be arranged during Reading Week.]",First semester (Wed),"- Dr T.

It enables students to understand how their own lives and personal choices are shaped by global interconnectedness. The first part of the course has two components. First, it overviews globalization: what it is, how it started, and its positive and negative effects. Contemporary theories of globalization are introduced. Then it examines today’s global governance system (through international organizations) and how international, intergovernmental, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drive globalization, and respond to world challenges, such as economic slowdown and environmental degradation.In this part of the course, students will compare and analyze how diverse individuals’ lives are impacted by globalization. Major factors include migration; market forces; global climate change; technology; education; and movement of cultures, values, religions, and ideologies… for better and for worse. Central to the course will be the question of how globalization has changed the lives of students, teachers, communities, governments, and international organizations around the world. The cases invite students to reevaluate the major theoretical orientations to globalization discussed in the course, reflect on major debates about globalization, and hypothesize its future impacts.",First semester (Wed),"- Professor L.

A variety of sources contribute to the Big Data, including the Internet, Wikipedia, social networks (e.g. Facebook), micro blogs, mobile phones, and cameras. This era of “information burst” has brought convenience to our daily lives. More recently, the emergence of foundation models (e.g., GPT) is also an outcome of big data, massive high-quality is the fuel to the success training of these large machine learning models. However, the availability of such a vast amount of information has also created many problems. For example, reported incidents of leakage of private data, due to the use of the Foxy software, and the loss of USB drives that contain thousands of patients’ records, have raised serious legal and social concerns.The goal of this course is to engage students in examining the critical issues that they could encounter in the Age of Big Data. They will examine how Big Data is affecting our society and daily lives and how Big Data is used in our daily life. They will study the security and credibility issues of Big Data.

Language presents one of the most important (but not exclusive) power resources. We will learn that language can be both powerful and empowering. We will discuss how people in power can influence the ways in which language is used, and exercise control over access to language by others. We will also examine examples of how these others, in their turn, can contest and negotiate power. In language power can be expressed in a more or less overt ways. To minimize opposition, for example, power is increasingly exercised covertly or indirectly in different institutions. A particular attractive feature of the course is that we will examine real-life language data collected in a number of Hong Kong institutions.

"""CCST9085 – Inspiration from the Living World""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:It is important to remind ourselves that human existence is rooted in the natural world. We rely heavily on a wide range of species that we often take for granted in our modern tech driven society, including water and food supplies, disease protection, medicinal sources, base material for many consumer products. Venturing back to pre-human existence, our very evolution has been shaped by the changing living world around us, influencing our ancestral lineages into our current fundamental form and mindsets. Subsequently, human society continues to move ever forward, which in-turn continues to shape the world around us leading to a new horizon of biological diversity. Given the high impact of human decisions on biological diversity, our current society will need to decide how we will approach this future horizon for the benefit of human society and the amazing biological diversity we rely upon.This course will explore the diversity of life and its relationship with human evolution and modern elements of human society. Beginning with an understanding of the origination and importance of biodiversity this course will explore the integral role of the natural world in shaping modern human society and culture. Delving deeper into current aspects of human society the course will assess the direct impacts of biological diversity on human sustainability, including food, medicine and antagonistic interactions. Subsequently the course will encourage participants to engage critically to evaluate the current and future role biological diversity is destined to play as human society continues to develop. Finally the course will explore the impact of biological diversity on the creative elements of human culture stemming from ancient mythology to modern inspiration in art and recreational activities.[There will be a compulsory one-day field trip to the Hong Kong Wetland Park scheduled during Reading Week] ",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr M.S.

"""CCHU9071 – Man Up: Masculinities in the Making""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Today, men are facing what many consider a crisis. Male students are outnumbered by females at most universities in the developed world. More young men are being out-earned by their wives. Some men demand more rights in education and parenting, and argue that feminism has victimized men. Meanwhile, popular culture continues to define men as hyper-masculine, violent and homophobic. These phenomena raise the same questions: Where do men stand today? What is the future of men?Man Up explores from various perspectives how men have confronted, deflected or negotiated the challenges facing them. We look at why, across different times and spaces, some masculine traits are celebrated and some are demonized. Why are single and affluent men, for example, named ‘the golden bachelors’? Why are men more likely to be depicted as criminals than women?Man Up shows how the definition of masculinity today is a result of physiological, social and economic influences. It seeks to explore complex debates around such issues as male sexuality, family relations and nation-building. Through investigating different views of masculinity through history and other disciplines, students will reflect upon and challenge existing rhetorics, tropes and opinions.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr C.L.

The quality of life of future generations will depend on the decisions we make, and how we design our planet today. Our powerful human imagination has enabled us to produce more mobile devices than people, build highways, immense cities, alter soils, crop genetic materials, redirect rivers, melt glaciers, design the chemistry of the atmosphere and the oceans, manufacture enough weapons to destroy humankind several times over. The ways humankind has lived and acted over the past centuries embody the idea that the earth has an unlimited supply of resources and that nature is there for humans to take and exploit. This must change.Prompted by Einstein’s well-known quote that “we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used to create them,” this course will guide students into exploring a series of both mainstream and more controversial responses to climate change. We will criticise, debate, role play and imagine new narratives, models and metrics of success and ultimately design and advocate for a future we want. We will use Hong Kong 2100 as the theater of this speculative design work to build a better response to climate change.

Through examples gathered from the long history of humankind, around our daily lives, and in diverse areas of human activities, this course aims to help students to comprehend how mathematics was, and is being, developed as a work of human endeavour with cultural, intellectual, and social contexts. We will also investigate the role of mathematics in the development of other areas of our civilization. In particular we shall examine the interplay between mathematics and other pursuits such as philosophy, the arts, and science and technology, and to study how they have affected each others’ development. Rather than transmitting a body of technical knowledge in mathematics, our emphasis is placed on appreciating, contemplating, and examining the beauty, the utility, and the “Way” of mathematics, as well as the intricate relationship between mathematics and other human cultural pursuits.The demand on technical preparation in mathematics is minimal, say up to the level of the general mathematics curriculum in secondary school, but the student is expected to possess intellectual curiosity and willingness to participate in the reasoning process. As an example, instead of calculating integrals, we would be interested in this course in the question of why integrals exist and what they are used for. Imagine looking at a painting of one of the masters and discussing it with your friends; you need not be a master painter to appreciate the work of the masters, and our aim is to explain the beauty that lies within mathematics, even if you are not a “mathematical master painter”.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr B.R.

"""CCHU5074 – Beyond Fake News (Online)""","[Lectures and tutorials of this course will be delivered online.]Never before has the need for “news literacy” been more urgent for our healthy civic life. A constant stream of fraudulent news stories in our daily media diet has given rise to troubling cultural trends and alarming political movements in recent years across the world. False claims, misleading factoids, exaggerations, propaganda, hoaxes, rumors, satire, questionable advertising, radical extremism, and other types of misinformation and disinformation are now being masqueraded as journalism.We need to understand the complexity of information disorder and its intertwined ecology composed of human behavior, computer algorithms, and strategic communication tactics. We need to know how to effectively navigate through the abundance of media content in order to identify dependable facts and recognize an intricate web of factors affecting our perceptions from culture to ideology.Drawing on data science, statistics, digital forensics, journalism, cognitive science, social psychology, marketing, politics, and media studies, this inquiry-based, hands-on course teaches how to conceptualize methods of news consumption. Students will investigate specific topics and work on case studies in order to acquire a more advanced digital tool dexterity as well as a more analytical mindset.[The 2-hour lecture and 1–hour tutorial will be held back to back each week on Wednesday.] ",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr M.

But do you really know what information is, at its most fundamental level? Do you know what role information plays in the fundamental laws of nature? Have you ever thought that the world around us, from tiny particles to enormous galaxies, could be made of information? This course explores the fascinating interplay between information and fundamental physics, making connections with everyday life, art, literature, and popular culture. We will learn about a new type of information, called quantum information, which arises in the world of elementary particles, and promises to have huge impact on society and everyday life. We will see that fundamental questions about quantum information and the nature of reality have led to the invention of powerful new technologies, such as secret communication systems that cannot be decrypted by any hacker, and ultrapowerful computers that will overcome today’s best supercomputers. Finally, we will explore how quantum information is changing our view of the universe, transforming our notions of space, time, cause and effect. Do not worry: the course will not use any equations or any physics knowledge.

"""CCGL9055 – Genocide: The Nightmare from History""","This course is under the thematic cluster of: Course DescriptionGenocide, defined as the use of state-sanctioned power to pursue the eradication of a minority group in a non-military context raises fundamental questions about co-existence, morality, viability, security and survival within the modern world system. Known as the “nightmare of history,” Genocide is arguably the most disturbing of all of the innovations of modernity. Emerging in the 20th Century, Genocide has been perpetrated upon adherents of almost all major world religions and continents and its occurrence has repeatedly challenged the outside world to adequately recognize, represent, understand and judge this distinctly modern crime that constitutes an assault on human life itself. On a case by case basis, drawing from the main examples of Genocide globally recognized by scholars (Nama/Hereo, Armenian/Assyrian, Jewish/Roma, Cambodian/Chinese/Cham, Hutu/Tutsi), we shall pursue a comparative analysis of this topic. In our exploration we shall highlight what is fundamental and common to each case, namely, the role of media propaganda in the demonization of victim groups by perpetrators and the unsatisfactory search for justice in the aftermath. Finally, our class will meditate upon what brings humans to participate in the destruction, preventive measures that might be possible, and which narratives on this topic may be more easily accessible to a wider public.It asks about victims and perpetrators, about justice and retribution, about legal responses and their absence, and about the (in)ability to prevent genocide on an individual, state, and international level.Course Learning OutcomesOn completing the course, students will be able to:Articulate critical understanding of instances of genocide as a global issue, and the broader implications of genocides past and present for individuals and societies.Critically assess questions of cultural/ethnic belonging in relation to cases of genocide; identify power hierarchies and instances of scapegoating and ‘othering’.Reflect on their roles as members of the global human community, and articulate their awareness of associated rights and responsibilities.Acknowledge and respect the value of their own and others’ humanity, and articulate responses to genocide demonstrating the social, moral, and political responsibilities incumbent upon a global citizen.Offer Semester and Day of TeachingSecond semester (Wed)Genocide, defined as the use of state-sanctioned power to pursue the eradication of a minority group in a non-military context raises fundamental questions about co-existence, morality, viability, security and survival within the modern world system.

There are fewer marriages, easier divorces and more children born to single parents. Wars give rise to displaced families, whose households are constantly on the move. We are told that the nuclear family ideal has become out of date. Multigenerational families, single parent families, queer families and childless families have become increasingly popular globally. We are Family explores the possibility that the more diverse the families we live with, the more obsessed we are with the myths of family, the stories that are so regularly depicted across our media. Rather than a static institution, the family must be understood as an imagined construction with a long history and politics.This course, which moves across multiple disciplines, considers a series of intriguing questions such as: What makes an ideal family? Should a single-person household be considered a family? How do queer families work? And how do technologies of reproduction impact the idea of family?Each interactive class session revolves around such philosophical questions and engages with historical and contemporary case studies of family across global settings. Methodologically, the course adopts an intersectional approach by exploring how categories of gender, race, class, disability and sexuality simultaneously empower and oppress individuals in the realm of family.What is your concept of family?

"""CCGL9010 – Sports Culture under Global Capitalism""","Sports capture the minds and bodies of billions of people around the world and have an immense significance in our everyday lives. This course engages different cross-cultural examples of sport and introduces students to the relationship between sport and its sociocultural settings.Sports inform and create certain lifestyles and values: they are about cooperation, inclusion, and fair play. But they are also about competition, inequality, and violence. Sports are highly structured, and yet at the same time totally unpredictable. Sports transmit moral principles and shape attitudes to life, but might also undermine authority and contribute to social instability. Sports can both unite and divide teams, groups of people, and even entire nations. Sports are not only shaped by society, but sports themselves shape society, dynamically intertwined as they are with moral education, socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity, nationalism, globalization.In this course, students will explore different cross-cultural examples of sports from all over the world, introducing the role and importance of sports in the present and the past, in “modern” and “traditional” societies, and seeing the relationship between sports and their sociocultural setting. We will draw on a variety of disciplines including sociology, anthropology, gender studies, history, and cultural studies.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr T.

"""CCHU9069 – Economic Logic of Civilizations: How Human Societies have Innovated to Deal with Risk""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Humans have become increasingly more civilized and violence has declined substantially in the last two millennia. Are we, though, really better species than before, or something else has happened? How have human societies innovated and developed increasingly better ways to deal with the challenges of risk events such as natural disasters, climate shocks, epidemic viruses, and wars? And how can financial knowledge help us understand the relationship between socio-economic history and the history of civilizations?This course addresses these global questions with an interdisciplinary historical approach, developing a risk-mitigation perspective on the evolution of human civilizations so that we can better understand how civilizations have evolved and how we can better foresee future growth areas in frontier, emerging, and developed markets. The course explores a number of human innovations, including mythology, magic, supernatural beliefs, technologies, social structures, cultural norms, religions, financial markets, and the welfare state. This broad scope of knowledge on the historical evolution of risk-sharing arrangements allows us to appreciate that cultures and institutions have each evolved historically as a way to maximize the probability of human survival, which in turn allows us to see where they will go as better risk-mitigating tools become available due to technological and financial progress.",Second semester (Wed),"- Professor Z.

How does the experience of our own genderedness and sexuality define members of sexual and gender minorities as people, and shape our opinions about those people who do not share our experiences or who do not express their sexuality in the same ways as we do? In this course, which has the potential to be life-changing, we will look at these sorts of questions and we will do so while learning about (and in many cases meeting and talking with) people whose gender or sexuality places them on the fringes of mainstream society. People who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or asexual; transgender people and individuals who cross dress, or play with bondage, domination, use pornography, and/or are involved in commercial sex activities. In lectures and tutorials we will examine questions such as: To what extent are sexual and gender diversity biologically ‘hard-wired’ rather than learned? What is ‘normal’ in human sexuality and gender? How, in an increasingly interconnected world, are our ideas about sexual and gender diversity changing? What are the intersectionality that we can discover in the whole course of learning and how do we use these learnings to help make a better world? We expect students will come out of the course with an informed, open-minded and critical understanding of the issues covered, and be better able to join contemporary debates on sexual and gender diversity, debates that so often stir deep emotions and challenge fundamental beliefs.","Course will be offered twice:

But at the same time, its underlying nature is still shrouded in mystery and hard to explain.This course uses an interdisciplinary approach to explore the fascinating complexities of the mind. It involves philosophical analysis, scientific investigation, and an awareness of history and the broader social and moral implications of technology. A central issue is whether the mind is a computer. Can computers display intelligence, creativity, and emotions? Can the computer model of the mind explain the mysteries of consciousness and free will? Or do these mental phenomena require the existence of a soul?These issues are exciting not just because they are intellectually important, but also because to understand the mind is to understand ourselves better. We will see how the ideas in this course can help us become better thinkers, and improve our creativity and decision-making skills. We will also discuss how science and technology can challenge our conception of the self and how they might affect future human evolution in radical ways.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr A.

"""CCHU9039 – Sexuality and Culture""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:The course will examine the relationships between sexuality and cultural issues in contemporary society. Apart from different sexual orientations and gender issues, we will look into ethical, and social conflicts with sexuality; for example, how sexuality is portrayed in creative social media which, in turn, shapes our perception of sexuality; the root causes of the stigmatization and discrimination of the commercial sex industry and sexually transmitted infections; the significance of sex education and family planning; and, how our legal system in the global community has been changing across time on non-mainstream sexuality and sexual violence.Our course aims to bring an interdisciplinary focus on sexuality issues, such as medicine, arts, law and social sciences to illustrate the range of human sexual beliefs and behaviors in various sexuality groups; develop the students’ critical thinking and application of different disciplinary approaches in the understanding of the changing roles and implications of sexuality; explicate and compare the cultural assumptions underlying sexual behaviors in local and global societies and to help students to reflect on these concepts in their personal growth; and create an innovative environment for students to tackle some of the local and global challenges in sexuality.This course brings a transdisciplinary approach with invited professionals from diversified realms, ranging from Faculties of Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences and Law, to give a more holistic study on relationships between sexuality and our increasingly interconnected world. It will also incorporate with online course materials, interactive elements, visual aspects such as films, creative works and mass media to facilitate a better illustration of theoretical concepts.

"""CCGL9024 – The Life and Death of Languages: Diversity, Identity and Globalization""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:This course critically examines the issue of endangered languages, with particular focus on the role of globalization, ethnic identity and language policies in the life and death of languages. Since ancient times, population movements, war and trade have affected the ways in which different languages have fared. Western colonization of many parts of the world brought about drastic changes in the ecology of languages, in particular a dramatic decrease in diversity. The distribution of languages in the world today reveals that 78% of humans today express themselves in one of 85 large languages, while the remaining groups of humans speak over 5,000 different minor languages. Why is there such an imbalance? The fact that a few global languages represent modern and powerful nations while thousands of small languages usually represent indigenous and marginalized groups leads to a discourse of endangerment in which a threatened language requires “saving” or revitalization efforts. Others argue that the demands of modernity and globalization challenge this view. Who is right? In this course students are led to a deeper examination of the political, cultural and educational forces that shape the destiny of languages, so as to be able to more insightfully discuss the tension between preservation and modernization of human cultural heritage in modern society.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr K.

These dynamic processes are inflected in characterization, plot development, and space-time configurations on Hong Kong screens. This course takes students on an interdisciplinary exploration of the local-global interactions from a variety of approaches.

Corruption has grown particularly fast since the marketization reform in 1978. Given its wide impact on economic growth, social stability and welfare, corruption is arguably the topmost challenge to contemporary Chinese government in the 21st Century. Therefore, studying corruption and anticorruption in China enriches our understanding of the nature of Chinese culture, politics, and economy, and helps us foresee the prospects of China in the new millennium. In this course, through exploring major forms of corruption, the causes of corruption and the effectiveness of anticorruption measures in controlling corruption, students will get a glimpse of various perspectives on understanding contemporary China, such as the hidden rules of the Chinese state, the informal institutions of government, the formation of social network, elite politics, the legal system, and the media-government relationship.[A compulsory field visit may be scheduled during Reading Week.]",First Semester (Wed),"- Dr J.

Students will learn about interesting ways of watching films, film criticism, and especially how to communicate powerful ideas through short films. By the end of the semester, students will be able to communicate their own ideas on screen by using the method of remediation to visually discuss Hong Kong-related themes.Driven by an international range of film productions across time periods and genres, we will begin to develop a visual vocabulary through terms such as mapping, observation, narrative and montage in order to create our own short film adaptions. Using a ‘procedural mode of engagement’ — which we will explain in class — as a way of examining these contexts and frames, the course adapts film-making as an act of creative engagement with the built environment. This creative reservoir of residential atmospheres helps us to question our current place and time.

The course will begin by examining the historical roots of mass propaganda in Chinese media during the Mao Era, analyzing its development from political, social, and cultural dimensions. Subsequently, the course will delve into how Deng’s market liberalization policies have infused profit-making mechanisms that have reshaped media practices, all while the government maintains control. The course will use specific examples to illustrate how the emergence of new media technology, fortified by Xi’s media convergence policy, has enabled the voice of the people to be heard, amplifying media’s role as a mass communication vehicle both domestically and globally. Throughout the semester, the course will utilize the “people, propaganda, and profit” framework to examine the implications of shifting relations between the state, market, and society on cultural and media production, consumption and reception.This course engages in a cross-disciplinary exploration of the social consequences of the evolving media environment in China.

"""CCST9064 – The World Changed by DNA""","Imagine that we turned all the information in our DNA into ‘1’s and ‘0’s. That would be 1.5 gigabytes (GB) of data! To think that this information can determine everything about ‘who we are’ is a frightening thought, but we can now easily obtain this code for each individual in just a matter of days. Ten years ago, the letters A, T, C and G may only have been relevant in a biology exam, but nowadays it means so much more! When your gym reports that you possess the ‘warrior gene’, does it mean you will do particularly well in your workups? Why do twins turn out to be completely different when they grow up in different countries? Are all our problems our parent’s fault? Or is ‘someone’ or ‘something else’ responsible too?This course aims to explore the ways that the DNA code can influence our lives and well-being. The content will be applicable to students from any background and participants will also get to meet representatives from non-governmental organizations and learn from their perspectives. The teaching will be primarily lecture-based and the assessment will be 100% coursework.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr B.H.Y.

Why are many Chinese women obsessed with having children, if not a male heir? How did the reforms and revolutions in China shape the notion of motherhood? What does it mean to be a mother in China today? Mothering China seeks to answer these questions from the perspectives of the state, elites, NGOs, and both women who are and are not mothers. The course explores how motherhood in China transformed from a personal experience to a national duty and the question of how national leaders and social elites constructed, sustained and altered the image of mothers between the late nineteenth century and now, a period marked by rapid sociopolitical changes in China. Through a variety of disciplinary lenses, and using dominant trends of mainland China as well as cases of mothering practices in Hong Kong and Taiwan, we will discuss a wide range of material including texts, films and adverts in order to align the changing image of Chinese mothers with the broader history of China’s twentieth-century revolutions.​",First semester (Wed),"- Dr C.L.

"""CCGL9018 – Corporate Social Responsibility""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:This course provides an interdisciplinary overview of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), focusing on the interplay between corporations and their key stakeholders. Over the past several decades many factors have contributed to increased expectations for corporations to carry more social responsibilities. Asia is not an exception. At the same time, our governments have acted to reduce their roles in addressing social problems, in favor of market-based approaches.CSR has progressed from traditional philanthropy and donation to encompass not only what companies do with their profits, but also how they make them. Through their stakeholder relations management and innovative business models, companies can not only develop practices to address environmental and social issues, but also identify opportunities for innovative products and technologies.In recent decades the emergence of CSR has brought a new wave of social innovations to the marketplace. “Social enterprises” have emerged that emphasize both social and financial sustainability, and, therefore, traditional non-profit organizations, governments and corporations need to adapt themselves to embrace this social innovation. Thus, the topics of sustainability reporting, nonprofit organizations, social enterprises and other topics of interest to students will be discussed in-depth to bring this course to a more forward-looking perspective.",Second semester (Sat),"- Dr S.L.K.

"""CCCH9031 – Property Rights, Built Heritage and Sustainable Development in Hong Kong""","The goal of this course is to stimulate students’ interest in built heritage conservation and utilization, along with a view to motivate and empower them to partake in community action for heritage conservation as responsible citizens. Through organized and guided local field studies on selected Hong Kong military and civilian built heritage sites and lectures, the course examines how built heritage conservation, as an emerging policy issue in Hong Kong and the rest of China, can be understood in terms of basic concepts of property rights and sustainable development.  It introduces simple theoretical concepts of property rights and sustainability to students through observing examples of built heritage conservation in Hong Kong from a media perspective and from personal experience as informed by an awareness of relevant policy initiatives and social actions. Students will have opportunities to review selected case studies in tutorials and participate in organized field trips to selected Hong Kong military and civilian heritage sites.  The knowledge base is in the fields of architecture, property rights, building development, and development control.  Attention will be particularly drawn to examples of local real life attempts to transform areas suffering from environmental degradation into positive and attractive sustainable uses. [This course has a MANDATORY field trip component as a primary vehicle of learning.  There will be a total of three field trips (9:30am to 5:00pm). Any of these trips will be rescheduled, shortened or cancelled in case of heavy rains, typhoons or public health requirements.  Students will need to purchase government aerial photos, plans and survey maps (costing not more than about HK$500 per student) for completing the assignments based on fieldwork.] ",First semester (Sat),"- Dr. L.H.T.

"""CCHU9014 – Spirituality, Religion and Social Change""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:The aim of this course is to engage you in a reflection on spirituality and religion, and on their relevance to contemporary social change. It will aim to do so in a manner which is personally meaningful, appropriate for critical analysis, and relevant to social action. Society is undergoing a resurgence of religious or spiritual beliefs and practices. Many of us are personally committed to spiritual or religious beliefs, are engaged in what could be called a “spiritual search”, or at the very least have many questions of a spiritual nature. As faith in secular ideologies declines, there is a growing tendency to turn to religious traditions as conceptual and social resources for personal growth and social engagement. But is this appropriate or even right? In the past few decades the world has witnessed a dramatic resurgence of spiritual seeking and religious engagement in society, in ways that may be either constructive or destructive. Given the historical record, is it realistic to expect religion to provide answers to personal and social problems?Open to believers, agnostics, skeptics, atheists and seekers, this course will give you exposure to, and an opportunity to engage with, the spiritual heritage of humanity. You will explore topics such as human operating systems, objects of consciousness, the mindscape, spiritual practices, existentialism, materialism, the meaning of life and death, ritual and mythology, human nature, the evolution of religion, religion and society, and the crisis of religion. You will discuss teachings of some of the world’s major religious traditions, as well as spiritual themes contained in popular feature films. You will critically consider the contemporary social implications of religious teachings and spiritual principles. You will reflect on whether these approaches to human spiritual life are part of the cause or part of the solution for global social problems.",Second semester (Wed),"- Professor D.A.

"""CCCH9025 – Humanity and Nature in Chinese Thought""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:This course explores the ways Classical Chinese Masters teachings impacted Chinese social ethics throughout its history. These masters had distinctive understandings and approaches to the relation between the human, social realm and the realm of nature. The dominant tendency in traditional Chinese ethical, religious, and political thought has been to ground ethical and political ideals in a normative conception of humanity’s relation to nature, as epitomized by the slogan, “nature and humanity join as one”. The course explores the conceptions of humanity, nature, and the relation between them that underlie the many competing versions of this ideal of naturalistic humanism. Students will be led to chart their own view of our relation to nature, grounded in culturally authentic concepts and patterns of thinking, with the aim of enhancing their appreciation of Chinese ethical and philosophical culture, on the one hand, and modern scientific and philosophical naturalism, on the other.

Each of us has a personal relationship to architecture and the city as well as a felt understanding of space through our daily encounter with the built environment. It can therefore be exciting and useful to better understand how the world in which we live is planned, conceived and represented in order to take part in the shaping of that world.Architects and planners use drawings, models and other representations to consider, communicate and construct the spaces of our everyday lives. These forms of spatial representation have the capacity to do much more than lay out the foundations for buildings or cities. They are also mechanisms of provocation, discourse and critique. They make arguments, influence society and change the course of history. Students will consider the meanings behind various modes of spatial representation and the impacts of those visions.Through weekly lectures, writing exercises, tutorial discussions and the making of photographic and filmic representations of Hong Kong, students will develop a capacity to engage with different forms of spatial representation and to articulate a personal understanding of their relationship to architecture and the city.",Second semester (Wed),"- Mr H.

Are women natural homemakers? Is it wrong for women to enjoy sex? Should women be given access to birth control and the right to abort? How should women confront sexual violence? What are the opportunities and challenges facing lesbians and transgender women? How do women fight?During the course we engage in the big debates about women’s livelihood across time, space and culture. To what extent have social expectations for women changed throughout history? How have these expectations been enforced and resisted by women? What do women think about themselves today?Rethinking Women focuses on contemporary societies through the critical lens of the past. It explores the great strides that women have made in educational and professional achievement in recent decades. But it also explores the social expectations and gender stereotypes that continue to limit women’s capacity to develop their abilities and make life choices. The aim is to encourage students from diverse backgrounds to rethink and challenge the assumptions about women’s identities and experiences. In Rethinking Women we discuss a wide range of material, including texts, films and adverts in order to consider such issues as gender relations, sexuality and reproductive rights, through facilitating a dialogue between the sexes. The course presupposes no previous knowledge of the subject.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr C.L. Tsang School of Humanities (History), Faculty of Arts: Tel: 3917 2864 Email: cctsang1@hku.hk

This course provides an interdisciplinary and critical analysis of the impact of globalization on Hong Kong culture. We start by asking: What is culture? What are the important global cultural trends that Hong Kong also participate in and contribute to? What aspects of globalization are relevant to the study of Hong Kong culture? How can postcolonial Hong Kong culture offer new ways to understand the relation between the colonial past and the present global world order? How can we understand the global-local cultural dynamics that drive Hong Kong into the future? What will we learn about Hong Kong culture if we adopt new critical and self-reflective perspectives? The course introduces key concepts and theories of globalization by focusing on cultural analyses and critical cultural responses to globalization. Particular emphasis is placed on the creative media, transnational cultural industries and global cultural phenomena relevant to everyday Hong Kong experience. This includes the analysis of Hong Kong’s participation in global cultural trends like the creation of cultural districts, the changing emphasis on cultural industries, the conditions of cultural production and consumption, the proliferation of urban redevelopment framed in terms of cultural heritage preservation and tourism, as well as the transformations in our everyday experience due to global cultural trends like the Disneyization and McDonaldization of society, new technologies of video and internet gaming and other new media phenomena.","Course will be offered twice:

"""CCGL9070 – The Birth of the City and the Shaping of Societies""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Cities are said to be our greatest inventions. They are demonstrations of human ingenuity, power, and capacity to manipulate resources and the environment. Cities also play crucial roles in transforming human settlement patterns and habitats and in shaping human development on both individual and collective levels. In this course, we will start by examining how the unprecedented urbanization since the 18th century has turned our planet into ‘Earthopolis’. We will discuss how cities have become the epicentres by which our human species exerts its widespread, and potentially irreversible, impact on the planet earth, initiating a new geological era identified by many scientists as ‘Anthropocene’. We will guide you to explore the circumstances and process through which different urban civilizations achieved major milestones in the urban form, governance, and culture, shaping the ways we live, work, and play in cities today. We will engage creatively around ideas of sustainable urban development, basic questions of policy and planning, and questions of human flourishing particularly in the urban context. The course will arrange a field trip for you to visit a local cultural, ecological, high-tech, or housing development site so that you will gain a first-hand experience of a metropolitan area in the making.We invite you to join us in this exciting exploration of the making and remaking of cities from the rise of cities in ancient West Asia since the 4th millennium BC to the conurbation of metropolises and mega-regions in today’s world. By exploring the making of historical, modern, and contemporary cities in different cultures, this course aims to help you develop a critical and comparative understanding of the key issues, motivations, principles, institutions, and processes involved in city-making and how urban forms and functions interact with urban societies, together exuberating visions, beliefs, values, and power whilst shaping individual and collective identities, and experiences. The course will help you gain a deeper understanding of a rich social and cultural diversity in our urban heritage, learn from the rise and fall of urban societies, recognize the ongoing process of city-making, and develop a critical appreciation of the unprecedented scale, multi-functions, and commensurate responsibilities of modern and contemporary urban development. By understanding the basic principles by which cities are planned, designed, and governed in different parts of the world, you will obtain insights for optimising your urban experience. The course will also facilitate your cultivation of an interdisciplinary, historical, and planetary perspective on our urban trajectories so that you will be better equipped to contribute to global and local sustainable development.[There will be a compulsory fieldtrip scheduled during Reading Week.]Course Learning Outcomes",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr S.Y.

"""CCCH9014 – Social Development: China, Asia, and the World""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Starting in the late 1970s, the Open Door Policy ushered in an era of privatization, decentralization, modernization, and the dismantling of the Mao era’s ‘iron rice bowl’. The reforms have had a profound impact on Chinese society, creating a rising quality of life and income, but also contributing significantly to rising inequalities, environmental degradation, and retrenchment of social welfare entitlements.Is inequality a necessity to motivate social development? Who are the emerging urban poor, and how can China achieve poverty reduction? Why is it expensive and difficult to obtain quality health care? How can welfare policy help to achieve social integration? How is China’s social development status compared with other Asian economies and the world? This course focuses on the nature and magnitude of key social development challenges in China, and how Chinese policymakers and the emerging civil society are addressing them. Key questions explored will include indicators and frameworks of social development, the limits of market power in providing social goods, trending social issues, and the progress and challenges of policy and social service in the Chinese institutional context in a globalizing world.The course relies extensively on current information including news reports, video clips, in-class discussions, and group activities to explore the topics.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr C.

Through what processes is our built environment constituted? How do we dwell in our cities and how do different kinds of urban space shape our sense of place and community belonging? This course explores practices of urbanism across a range of contexts from antiquity to the present day. By doing so it allows students to develop insights into the social relations and human struggles that have been produced by, and continue to produce, particular types of built forms in different places over time. In the broadest sense, the course uses urbanism as a lens to understand the relationship between urban forms and the complex, multiple processes that constitute cities and their urban milieus.The course content is organized around sets of case studies, with each focusing on a specific theme that indicates particular continuities and congruencies between cities of different locations and time periods. Discussions throughout the course engage with questions related to contemporary urbanization and consider how historical knowledge may impart a better understanding of the challenges we are facing in the global present.Assignments of this course include a series of exercises that combine historical research, visual analysis and creative writing.

Can political power be performed in a range of sartorial guises?From Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Met Gala white gown with the message “tax the rich” emblazoned in red, to the black T-shirts and yellow ribbons of Hong Kong protesters, to the rise of MAGA as a kind of anti-fashion, it is clear fashion is an important aspect of political performance.Fashion is politically meaningful and consequential, but it continues to be generally ignored in intellectual life, perhaps because it is usually associated with the frivolous and insignificant. Yet the line between high politics and frivolous fashion is drawn less clearly than expected.Engaging in different disciplines – including visual and digital culture, economics, philosophy, history, anthropology, and media studies – the course will work with students to explore the relationships between fashion and global politics. What are you wearing today? How do your clothes express your identity? How, in your everyday life, do fashion and politics intersect?This course, which draws on the cities of “high” and “low” fashion, aims to show the close connections of fashion and politics in a globalised world.

Using contemporary sociological and political theories of identity, gender and sexuality, this course aims to track down the major transformation in the realm of sexual intimacy in modern times and to examine newly emerged ethical issues, moral dilemmas and social conflicts over sexual intimacy in four inter-related domains: (a) democracy, human sexual rights and citizenship – how these issues are important in talking about intimate relationships; (b) mass media and popular culture – how private matters become increasingly subject to public scrutiny; (c) economy and consumption – how intimacy is increasingly commodified and commercialized; and (d) science, medicine and computer technology – how medical and computer technologies foster new pleasures, bodies and practices and the problems that arise from this. At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to think critically about intimacy, to understand the complex interplay between self and society and to have learnt how to respect individual differences and preferences.",Second semester (Sat),"- Dr T.S.K.

"""CCHU9044 – Creative Arts as a Way of Knowing""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Understanding human existence and the world is broader than scientific comprehension. In every culture and moment of history, expression of the human experience is based as much in literal and verbal discourses as it is in the arts. Visual arts, music, dance, drama, poetry, and literature have always provided imagery to document, explore and understand life. The symbolic and multiple meanings conveyed through both viewing and creating art offers enormous space in which imagination and creativity can be cultivated for knowledge. A guiding question throughout this course is, “How do the creative arts increase our ability to know more about the world, others, and ourselves?” Beginning with the roots of art expression in ritual settings offers an approach to seeing art as innate to the human experience, particularly in bringing order, making meaning and transforming the ordinary. This same urge to create allows us to appreciate the arts for expressing emotion, sharing thoughts, and reflecting on attitudes. As such, the arts serve as a vehicle for enhancing an empathic and intimate understanding of others and oneself. Engaging in creative arts offers unlimited access to unique, non-verbal, and sometimes unconscious content of human experience, thereby promoting world, other and self-understanding.",Second semester (Wed),"- Professor R.T.H.

"""CCCH9027 – China’s Ethnic Groups: Cultural Assimilation or Cultural Pluralism?""","[This Common Core course is of a ‘flipped classroom format’, i.e., much of the traditional in-class lecturing will be replaced by video lectures and other online learning materials, thus the time-tabled lecture hours will be used for collaborative learning activities.]Contemporary China is a multiethnic state with a 116 million population. Ethnic autonomous areas occupy 50% of the country and 90% of the borders with 16 other countries. The government recognizes 55 ethnic minority groups based on their historical origins, mode of production, language, culture, customs, religion, and a sense of solidarity.What interethnic processes are at work in multiethnic China? How does the state manage ethnic relations? What is the balance between centralization and ethnicization? What is the difference between pluralism and assimilation? As China becomes the most powerful economy in the world, what can other multiethnic countries learn from China’s experience?This course examines how China’s civilization, institutions, laws and policies address the challenge of multiethnic integration. The course presents an opportunity to learn about some of China’s many ethnic groups, such as the Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongols, Huis, Koreans, Lahus, Dongxiangs, Naxis, Miao, Yao, and others. The course will highlight the variety of ethnic customs, religious practices, music, art, dance and other cultural traditions. Finally, the course examines how education, as a mechanism of cultural reproduction and transmission, shapes and is shaped by ethnic identities.Students in the class can also share their own interethnic experience and consider what it means to be ethnic in the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. The course introduces the idea of cross-cultural communication as a way to bridge the differences between your own culture and the cultures of other ethnic groups locally, regionally, and globally.The course uses a flipped classroom and tutorial format as a way to discover innovative ways to think about China’s future as a highly diverse civilization. Students work collaboratively with classmates in small groups to identify, compare, and analyze the way that social, economic, and cultural challenges are addressed by different ethnic groups.",Second semester (Wed),"- Professor G.A.

"""CCST9017 – Hidden Order in Daily Life: A Mathematical Perspective""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Although not obvious, mathematics actually permeates many areas of our modern society, affecting us fundamentally on an everyday basis. For example, the Human Genome Project, GPS systems, and mobile phones use mathematics extensively as well as other non-science matters such as financial investment, data encryption, and internet searching. Even voting systems, an important feature of our democracy, can be analyzed with the help of mathematics, enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of what is meant by fairness of a voting system or a social choice procedure and its limitations. Through exploring non-technically some mathematically rich daily life topics, this course aims to help students gain essential mathematical literacy for living in the 21st century. Students will learn the mathematical concepts and principles of things that they encounter in modern society, and learn how to handle and interpret numerical and other forms of mathematical data that affect their daily life.* Note: Mathematics beyond the level of general school mathematics is not required. The focus of the course is on demonstrating analytical reasoning, formulating evidential and logical arguments, and presenting and communicating the coherent body of knowledge acquired.","Course will be offered twice:

"""CCHU9075 – Buddhist Architecture: Monasteries in Cross-Cultural Developments""","The course introduces the knowledge of Buddhist architecture in China and Asia, looking into its physical and visual significance, as well as aesthetic idea and spatial practice. By studying selected examples of monastery, it reviews form and space, visual representation and meaning, artistic creation and garden making, ritual performance and spiritual aspiration. Exploring such a wide range of issues enables us to unfold the richness of Buddhist built environment. Taking both historical and cross-cultural perspectives, the course addresses these inquiries by investigating how architectural concepts are developed within and across Asia’s interconnected regions. Beyond chronological and thematic examinations of cave temples, pagodas, monasteries, gardens, sculptures, and paintings, the course also discusses the role of the Buddhist monastery as the living place of monastics, and in a broader context, the worship center, the secluded hermitage, and the contemplative landscape.",First semester (Wed),"- Professor W.J.

"""CCHU9006 – Girl Power in a Man’s World""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Girl Power has emerged as the subject of much popular, policy and scholarly interest as we move further into the millennium. This interest has been sparked by competing debates about girls and young women whose lives have long been shaped by male-dominant societies, and yet, who have, with the rapid changes resulting from a globalizing political economy, recently experienced a surge of new opportunities and challenges. These range from choices about personal health, sexuality, education and occupations to changes in their roles in their interactions with family, peers, and colleagues. Boys and men have also had a significant role in “Girl Power”. The relevance of girls’ empowerment – the emerging opportunities, the traditional demands, and the choices created – clearly extends beyond the borders of developed countries. Indeed girls’ and women’s issues are core to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that specify targets to be attained by 2030 to end poverty, mitigate inequality, and protect our planet. Against this background this course considers (i) notions about girlhood from its early biological emphasis to contemporary frameworks that are informed by anthropology, psychology, economics, sociology, and politics; and (ii) the cultural meaning and consequences of girl power in both developed and developing societies, paying particular attention to the ways in which the male dominant world has both assisted and hindered girls’ development.",Second semester (Wed),"- Professor N.

"""CCHU9081 – Urban Legend: Fact, Myth and Reinterpretation""","Do people really scatter ashes of deceased loved ones at the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland? Is the driving of hopping zombies in western Hunan Province real? How about the unsettling Wah Fu Estate UFO sighting in the 1970s and 1980s? Urban legends are folk narratives set in our times that reflect the moral judgements, hopes, desires, fears, and anxieties of our lives. These stories are usually circulated with vivid details, sometimes sinister but persuasive because of their mundane background. Residing in every aspect of our society, some urban legends go viral worldwide within minutes once they hit the internet. The increasing complication of the quasi-public online environment is stretching the significance and relevance of urban legends in the community to a new limit. Students in the course will study this widespread and trending genre from different perspectives, from the transitional folk narrative to storytelling, from exploding the history and origins of certain legends to their social implications. Students are encouraged to form their own interpretations of urban legends from Hong Kong and other parts of the world using anthropological, sociological, psychological, and literary approaches accompanied with case-studies from different media and platforms.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr C.P.

"""CCHU9052 – The Best Things in Life: A Philosophical Exploration""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:This course helps students address difficult issues raised by the question of what makes a good life. It begins by discussing a few fundamental questions: What does it mean to live an examined life? Is an unexamined life worth living? How can philosophy help us pursue an examined life? The course then proceeds to examine some existing accounts of good life—hedonism, desire-fulfillment, and objective list theories. It then invites students to discuss things that are often thought to give value to human life: freedom, authenticity, love, sexuality, and virtue. The course also looks at questions that concern the meanings of life and hard choices: Can we ascribe meanings to our lives? What makes death bad? How should we confront hard choices?In examining the “best things in life,” the course will introduce and evaluate several major philosophical theories of the good life, namely, hedonism, desire-fulfillment theory, and the objective list approach. Hedonism holds that the only value in life is pleasure and that the best life is one that has the maximum amount of pleasure. The desire-fulfilment theory denies that there is any intrinsic good that people must experience in order to have a good life. What determines the quality of our lives, according to this theory, is the extent to which our (informed) desires are fulfilled. The objective list approach argues that there are several intrinsically valuable things, pleasure included, that make life worth living. The course also critically discusses some visions of life developed by historical and contemporary thinkers.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr Y.

Since the discovery of fire, culinary practices have been instrumental in the progress of human evolution. Culinary practices may be regarded as one of the oldest and most widespread applications of chemistry and physical sciences in everyday life. Traditionally, understanding and knowledge on cooking are based on collective experiences of diverse individuals passed down from generations to generations. In this course, we will guide the students to explore everyday life cooking and food preparation activities from scientific perspectives. We will examine critically the “folk knowledge” of cooking from the viewpoints of chemical, biological, physical and social studies. The aim of this course is to promote science literacy through exploring concepts and theories that are behind everyday cooking and cuisines.

"""CCHU9076 – The Journalist: Comics, Movies, Fiction and Fact""","Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent dropped his notebook and ripped off his shirt to save the world as Superman. Peter Parker took photographs for the Daily Bugle when not fighting crime in his alter ego as Spiderman. From the Green Hornet to the Flash to Lois Lane and Vicki Vale, journalists have been a fixture in comic book lore, as superheroes, adventurers, love interests, or, more importantly, as narrative plot devices. Likewise in fiction, with omniscient narrators like Thomas Fowler (The Quiet American), intrepid investigators like Mikael Bloomkvist (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo), and comedic voices like Bridget Jones and her diary, journalists have been ubiquitous in popular culture. So, what is it about journalists that makes them effective story characters? And how accurate are those depictions? Furthermore, how have popular culture portrayals of the journalist changed over time? And how has popular culture dealt with the real ethical dilemma journalists confront?Using comic books, movie clips, fiction, and the nonfictional narratives of working journalists, this course will examine the various portrayals of the journalist and how often they conform to reality. We will also look at how effective journalists have been at telling their own narratives — portraying the gritty reality or embellishing the comic book superhero version of the profession. From this course, through role playing and enacting live scenarios, students will learn more about the daily working life of journalists from beat reporters to foreign correspondents, better understand the ethical questions journalists face, and better appreciate the role of a free press in democratic societies.",Second semester (Wed),"- Mrs J.S.

"""CCGL9015 – Globalization and Migration""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:This course will introduce students to the key sociological perspectives of globalization and its impact on diverse forms of migration and mobilities. Lectures comprise two main themes. The first theme introduces some of the structural forces that shape different forms of precarious or criminalized migration (e.g. from trafficked persons, refugees and asylum-seekers, sex workers and domestic migrant workers), and elucidates the way the world economic order is underpinned by global economic disparities and widening class and gendered inequalities. The second theme introduces key debates about cross-border mobilities and provides a framework for understanding contestations around legality and ‘illegality’ in migration, national sovereignty, citizenship and belonging, and how these challenge our conventional understanding of migration across the global North-South divide. Our analysis of these issues will include engaging with those directly affected by global economic and migration policies, such as knowledge produced by domestic worker organizations and asylum seeker organizations. This course also presents an opportunity to critically analyse, not only the challenges that have arisen from different forms of globalization and migration, but also potential solutions or responses that have been proposed to address these challenges.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr S.A.

With the second largest number of WHS, China is a most suitable subject for understanding the concept. The course offers a general understanding of the criteria for the designation of WHS, but with emphasis on Chinese examples in the global context. Challenges associated with WH designation, such as the politics of the designation process and the impact of increased tourism on local communities, will also be addressed.Students will investigate, in particular, how World Heritage designation could be potentially applied to Hong Kong, which has been a recent popular topic of local debate, which will help students to think more critically about the culture and heritage of the city in which we are living. The final assignment will be presented via a digital platform, e.g. videos of local places, so that students can understand how World Heritage criteria can be applied in the local context using multi-media presentation techniques.[There will be a recommended field study to Tai O during Reading Week.]",Second Semester (Wed),"- Mr K.S.

"""CCGL9052 – Some We Love, Some We Eat: Human-Animal Relationships in the Global Marketplace""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Animals are everywhere and nowhere in modern societies. Except for the pets and animals in zoos, most animals are segregated from human’s everyday lives. Yet we eat them, wear them and “consume” them on a daily basis. In a globalizing world, our diverse relationships with animals stimulate questions on compassion, economics, urbanization, transnational mobility, global ethics and citizenship.The promotion of animal rights and ending animal cruelty is often regarded as one key mission for 21st century global citizens and has become a global social movement. There is now an increasing awareness of the global economy of animal trading and entertainment industry, rethinking the sociological, anthropological and scientific distinctions of human and non-human animals, and also of the new patterns of human-animal co-existence in urban cities. This course aims at stimulating students’ critical reflections upon different social constructions and moral implications of our relationships with the non-human creatures across cultures in the global marketplace.[There will be field trips scheduled during Reading Week.

"""CCHU9084 – The Law in Everyday Life""","The law is all around us. We interact with it every day in ways we may not even realise. In this course, we will critically examine the variety of ways (both overt and hidden) that we encounter and engage with the law in everyday life. We will learn how legal principles, constraints and ideas influence the films we watch, the books we read, and the art and music we experience. We will analyse how law forms an essential dimension of our history, how it is written into our language and ideas, and how it shapes even the structures of the city in which we live. The course draws on ideas from many disciplines. It is divided into a series of short topics, each of which introduces a different aspect of the law in everyday life. Over the course of the semester, we will consider how the law can act as an agent and an instrument, a human construction and a social superstructure, and we will discover the profound impact of law on the everyday world in which we live.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr A.M.

It engages students to look into the everyday life situations people with disabilities (PWDs) commonly encounter, particularly people with physical disabilities, special educational needs, as well as mental illnesses. Issues that arise from these situations will be examined through the critical lens of sociology, politics, culture, and social policies. Stereotypical images of PWDs, myths and erroneous assumptions about them, and the basis of discrimination against them are major aspects students will reflect upon. They will explore how these attitudes have been shaped by the media, cultural representations, knowledge from medical and social sciences and further obtain an empathetic understanding of PWDs through class activities and direct contact in NGOs or self-help organizations.By the end of the course, students should be able to appreciate the value of social inclusion and human diversities. They should be equipped to critically identify necessary amendments to be made in related social policies and service provisions and to take individual and collective actions in their future positions for building a more inclusive society.[There will be a compulsory agency visit scheduled during Reading Week.]",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr S.K.M.

"""CCHU9034 – Architecture and Film""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:This course examines how architecture and urbanism is represented in film and investigates how film influences and constructs the built environment – how it is experienced and perceived. Emerging as a twentieth-century phenomenon, the modern metropolis is the site of the most radical experiments of architects and planners, and an active subject in the imagination and actions of its diverse inhabitants. Film has a close relationship with the city and its architecture. How does architecture use its structure, form, enclosure, floor plans, materials and lighting to produce effects, evoke emotions and influence everyday lives? Likewise, how does film use space, architecture and landscape to situate its characters, create dramatic action and emotions?Focusing on popular film genres of postwar modern industrialized Hong Kong and other Asian cities––the melodrama, noir thriller, monster movie, sci-fi dystopian fantasy, comedy and crime drama––the course offers a cross-cultural perspective on how films have envisioned urban transformation due to the flows of capital, people, ideologies and imageries. It attends to how movies produce and reproduce the image of the city, their effect on the built environment and how they impact everyday experiences and perceptions of the city they live in. Through in-class analyses and discussions of film clips, film sets, city maps, building plans and texts, the course aims to deepen students’ understanding of how architecture and film influence each other, how they reveal social relations and construct narratives of modernity. Class readings are drawn from film studies, urban studies, global and cultural studies, architectural and design history and theory.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr E.M.F.

"""CCGL9026 – Think Global, Act Local: You, Hong Kong, and the World""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:The slogan, “Think global, act local,” has become a catch phrase, as global connections and interdependencies have vastly expanded and the importance of local engagement increasingly recognized. Given the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of the contemporary world, it is important for each of us to understand how we are linked to the multitude of people and places in it, and what impacts our actions have on them.In this course, we focus on global mega-trends from economic and environmental perspectives (e.g., economic globalization and climate change) and will discuss how the global trends have reshaped local economies and what local responses would be necessary in the face of such new environments. We will then further extend our discussion to examine how cities fare in a globalized world. For example, has Hong Kong contributed to promoting global economic and environment changes? Also, how may Hong Kong in turn be affected by them? We will use related theories to understand the changes in our lives in Hong Kong and in the world. Students who have taken the course should be able to answer both ‘big’ questions related to the global trend as well as seemingly ‘simple’ questions about everyday life.[Two field trips will be arranged during Reading Week, and students must participate in at least one.

"""CCHU9085 – When Animals Talk Back""","The “posthuman” turn in social theory has directed renewed attention to what non-human animals want. How can one know, when animals lack human language? What do attempts to communicate with animals tell us about animals, about humans and about language? This course looks at what it means to communicate with beings who do not, and will never, speak. We will investigate the field of human-animal communication from its inception with ape language projects to recent work on interspecies communication through an eclectic range of literature, including scientific studies, memoirs, novels and philosophical writing. Readings will include work by Donna Haraway, Jacques Derrida, Irene Pepperberg, JM Coetzee, Temple Grandin and others. Students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the literature — and, when assigned, the films — and they will be called on and asked to orally summarize the literature and discuss it, both with each other in small groups, and to the larger group. The course will help them develop critical listening and speaking skills, as well as new perspectives on what it means to live in a world with non-human sentient beings.",First semester (Wed),"- Professor D.

Somehow, activity of these neurons results in “consciousness”, and gives us our memories, abilities, creativity, and dreams. In this course, we will focus on how the brain controls some of the processes that we think of as making us human, such as language, memory, musical ability, learning, emotion, and so forth, and, in particular, whether there are differences between the two cerebral hemispheres, known colloquially as the “left brain” and the “right brain”. For each topic we will look at the way these abilities are instantiated in the brains of all of us, and also at what differences there might be in, say, musical processing between a skilled violinist and a complete novice. In addition, we will also look at fascinating case studies of people who have suffered brain damage and then lost some aspects of their conscious experience. Our aim is to critically evaluate claims about differences in function between the left brain and the right brain, for example in terms of “right brain learning”.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr J.H.W.

"""CCGL9069 – Multinationals and the Global Economy""","What are the drivers of globalization? When you read this question, you will most likely think of major nation-states such as China or the United States, international organizations such as the United Nations, and technological innovations, such as the internet or the airplane. However, there is another important driver that fuels globalization: multinational companies. These are companies that operate in more than one country and move, manufacture and market capital, commodities and services across borders, often owning assets and employing people throughout the world. Multinational companies are major pillars of the global economy, but at the same time shape our daily lives locally. In this course, you will explore how these multinational companies operate across the world and inﬂuence globalization. We will discuss the positive and negative effects the ever-growing presence of multinationals have on our lives, not only economically, but also in terms of the larger impact multinationals have on local cultures.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr G.

"""CCGL9058 – Villages and Global Futures""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Rural areas and village culture have defined the characters of today’s human settlements and its inhabitants’ way of life. Rural areas are increasingly considered as the solution space for global climate change adaptation and mitigation. Sustainable management of the water-energy-food nexus in urban-rural interface offers a local approach to tackle biodiversity loss, food security and water crises. Nevertheless, our rural environment and communities continue to deteriorate due to rapid depopulation and urbanization.Students in this course will learn about the socio-cultural, economic and ecological functions of rural areas and how these systems evolved and interacted under the processes of urbanization and globalization. Rural management approaches will be discussed investigating into current rural challenges such as disaster relief, planning and management of rural resources, and the governance regime and policy innovation under the recent trend of “urban-rural resilience” promoted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The changing role of various policy actors including officials, social entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, villagers as well as the wider public and their collective actions for rural sustainability attainment will also be discussed.Overseas case investigations will provide critical perspective into the range of rural revitalization strategies where the effectiveness of international recognitions, place branding, social innovations and collaborative governance models for rural sustainability is examined.By the end of the course, students will be able to cultivate an analytical perspective on the complexity of urban-rural linkages in relation to socioeconomic and ecological systems of rural sustainability.[A compulsory one-day field trip will take place during Reading Week.]",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr W.W.Y.

"""CCST9050 – Robot: Flesh, Machines, Intelligence""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:What happens when intelligence, flesh, and the machine intersect? Robots are playing an increasingly important role in applications including daily life, arts and entertainment, manufacturing, healthcare, and the military. They are getting ever closer to our lives, such that our ways of living will be substantially affected. This paradigm change raises a series of questions ranging from philosophy, technology, to economics. Through such wide-angle discussion about the applications of robotics in our daily life, students will not only be inspired by the numerous ground-breaking technologies which nurture our economics, medicine, arts, humanities and culture, but also will be capable of justifying the corresponding impacts in both positive and negative aspects. This course will offer students an opportunity to explore not only the technological advances of robotics, but also various key issues and perspectives such as a) The historical emergence of robots and their current prevalence in daily life; b) The relationship between the human body, machines, and intelligence; c) The general perception of robots and intelligent machines, in contemporary film, music, or video games; d) The cutting edge of robotic research; e) The major principles of problem solving in robotics; f) The socio-economical, legal and ethical impacts as well as the latest controversial issues of using robots.",First Semester (Wed),"- Dr K.W.

What interpretive tools are most appropriate to explore this subject matter? Scholars in Comparative Religion think that the answers to these questions lie in the rich diversity of world history. They find varying historical, social, and cultural contexts exhibit religious behaviour in which human beings construct and inhabit “religious worlds,” with the aim of giving life meaning and direction. In this course, following a historical and comparative perspective, we will attempt to “understand” this global human activity, “religion,” taking individual religions as distinctive “religious worlds.” We will explore these religious worlds through their common structures and cultural expressions such as myths, rituals, sacred space, pilgrimage, holy beings and holy communities, and their variations. Finally, we will work together to explore and appreciate the role of religion as a historical and contemporary force that has shaped our societies and institutions across geographies and histories.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr G.A.

"""CCGL5063 – How to Make (Sense of) Money (Online)""","[Lectures and tutorials of this course will be delivered online.]It is often said that “money makes the world go around”, but what, actually, is money? Why do we need it? How is money “created” both practically and socially?In a moment when “money” seems to be the answer for everything, understanding the nature and social significance of money is of vital importance for making sense of the contemporary world and how we should act in it.Covering everything from cowries to cryptocurrencies, this course examines money’s characteristics, exchange uses and values. We will investigate money’s origins, and how these inform contemporary attitudes to it. We will explore commonly-encountered economic perspectives on the functions of money for exchange, payment, storing and measuring value. We will complement this with sociological understandings of money as a “memory bank”: a system of relationships, a chain of promises, and a record of people’s transactions with one another.By adopting a comparative perspective that considers the use of money in different countries, this course will cultivate your ability to navigate the similarities and differences between your own and other cultures. Through a range of research exercises, group discussion and sharing, you will develop a critical understanding of how money impacts upon everyday life. Using this knowledge, you will be trained to ask important questions about the future possibilities of money and its consequences for society.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr T.

"""CCHU9042 – Human Language: Nature or Nurture?""","This course is under the thematic cluster(s) of:Language is an indispensable part of human experience, and yet, the ability to construct linguistic structures to make oneself understood and to interpret correctly the structures that others have produced is, almost always, taken for granted. The understanding of this course description is, in fact, made possible by a number of highly complex linguistic/cognitive processes in our mind. A fundamental question that arises, then, is how we human beings come to have this ability to possess and apply knowledge of language. How is it possible to obtain knowledge of language? Is language unique and specific to human beings? What are the stages of language acquisition? There are a number of different hypotheses regarding how human beings obtain knowledge of natural language. On the “nature” side, researchers argue that human beings are born with the ability to acquire and process language. Proponents on the “nurture” side, however, think that our ability to use language is learnt, much like how our other cognitive and intellectual abilities are learnt. In this course, students will be taken through a critical survey of these hypotheses, and consider what the various views tell us about the nature of the human mind. This course is of relevance and interest to anyone who uses language.",Second semester (Wed),"- Dr O.S.C. Lam School of Humanities (Linguistics), Faculty of Arts: Tel: 3917 2758 Email: osclam@hku.hk

This course intends to introduce a coherent understanding of the material world that we live in, and on how the “basic structure” question evolves over time from one which is religious and philosophical in nature to a scientific inquiry whose solution requires the construction of one of the biggest technological marvels ever built by humans, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This course aims to arouse students’ interests in “big science” topics such as the atomic theory and the mystical quantum nature of our world. The numerous applications of those fundamental particles, particularly contemporary ones related to our daily lives, such as quantum optics and quantum computing, will be highlighted to encourage students to appreciate the elementary, yet complex, nature of matter around us.",First semester (Wed),"- Dr J.C.S.

In order to explore these questions, this course adopts a broad understanding of humanitarian intervention, focusing primarily on the post-World War II period. We will look at a range of actors that act for humanitarian purposes; not only states, but also non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and intergovernmental organisations. We will also consider a range of forms of intervention; including armed intervention, humanitarian aid, peacekeeping, human rights promotion, and the international criminal justice system.Thus, the course focuses on the emergence of humanitarian intervention, its contemporary nature, successes and failures, moral challenges, and ways forward. The course examines dilemmas generated by great power politics, the tension between state sovereignty and global humanitarian action, and resource constraints in a world of potentially limitless need. The course will equip students to think critically about the possibilities and limits of effective humanitarian intervention and to creatively apply these insights to real-life cases around the world.",First semester (Sat),"- Dr M.
