# HKU Common Core Scrapper
***
## About this mini project:
for HKU student, it has been a bit problem always to choose right Common Core, since it is good for your GPA boosting and also workload is pretty important.
However, HKU does not provide a comprehensive list of Common Core courses, at least when I was a freshman and sophomore, so it was pretty hard to choose the right one.

Now you have a comprehensive list of common core with explanation, workload and assessment!

For easier usage, I don't want to recommend students to download the python file and run it on their computer!

This is the link to the google sheets: **https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W2My3sJ5XXXr8dBIGNEVJKtlwUtVv0si_nQW1ysp_vY/edit?usp=sharing**

### Feel Free to use the list and lemme noe if there is any problem.
I am planning to update the list by every year..? if there is any demand.
